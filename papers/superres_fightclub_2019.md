# [Super-resolution fight club: assessment of 2D and 3D single-molecule localization microscopy software](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0364-4)

This paper compares state-of-the-art algorithms in single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM). The alternating descent conditional gradient (<a href="adcg_2017.html">ADCG</a>) method along with other variants, which all fall into the class of algorithms derived from off-the-grid compressed sensing, consistently gave the best results for 2D high spot density.

The paper does not analyse deep learning based approaches such as <a href="deeploco_2018.html">DeepLoco</a>, but says that they show great promise especially for modelling more complex forward models.
