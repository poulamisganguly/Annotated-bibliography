Gridding method
---------------

We consider a 2D function in real space $m(x,y)$ whose Fourier transform
$M(u,v)$ is given by
$$M(u,v) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} m(x,y) e^{2\pi i (ux+vy)} dx dy.$$
In the tomography case, $M(u,v)$ is the Fourier transform of the image
we want to reconstruct.

We also define a sampling function $S(u,v)$ in Fourier space, which is
given by $$S(u,v) = \sum_{j=i}^{k} \delta(u-u_j, v-v_j).$$ The 2D delta
function in the equation above *samples* a function at points
$(u_j, v_j)$, which form any grid (i.e.Â not necessarily Cartesian) in
Fourier space. If we multiply this function to $M(u,v)$, we get a
sampled Fourier transform $$M_S(u,v) = M(u,v) \cdot S(u,v).$$ The fist
step of the gridding method is to convolve the sampled Fourier transform
with a suitable kernel $C(u,v)$:
$$M_{SC}(u,v) = [M(u,v) \cdot S(u,v)] \ast C(u,v),$$ where the
subscripts in $M_{SC}(u,v)$ denote the operations sampling and
convolution, respectively.

Next, the convolution shown above is sampled at Cartesian points
$$M_{SCS}(u,v) = \{[M(u,v) \cdot S(u,v)] \ast C(u,v)\} \cdot \Sha(u,v),$$
where $\Sha(u,v)$ denotes the Shah or comb function
$$\Sha(u,v) = \sum_{k} \sum_{j} \delta(u-k,v-j),$$ which samples points
$(k,j)$ that are equally spaced.

The reconstructed image $m_{SCS}(x,y)$ is given by the 2D inverse
Fourier transform of $M_{SCS}(u,v)$. Therefore,
$$m_{SCS}(x,y) = \{[m(x,y) \ast s(x,y)] \cdot c(x,y)\} \ast \Sha(x,y)$$

If the Fourier transform $M(u,v)$ is not sufficiently sampled by
$S(u,v)$, we cannot correct the aliasing of $m(x,y)$ via
post-processing. However, we can add an additional correction for
non-uniform sampling in Fourier space. For this, we consider an area
density function given by $$\rho(u,v) = S(u,v) \ast C(u,v).$$ Areas that
are oversampled have a large area density while those that are
undersampled have a small area density. Including this contribution in
(5), we get a sampled and weighted function
$$M_{SWCS}(u,v) = \Bigg\{\Bigg[M(u,v) \cdot \frac{S(u,v)}{S(u,v) \ast C(u,v)}\Bigg] \ast C(u,v)\Bigg\} \cdot \Sha(u,v)$$
and its corresponding inverse Fourier transform
$$m_{SWCS}(x,y) =  \{[m(x,y) \ast [s(x,y) \ast^{-1} (s(x,y) \cdot c(x,y))]] \cdot c(x,y)\} \ast \Sha(x,y),$$
where $\ast^{-1}$ denotes deconvolution.

The question that presents itself at this stage is how to choose a
kernel $C(u,v)$. This is discussed in the following section.

Ideal interpolation
-------------------

We note that for an ideal interpolation, the inverse Fourier transform
of our sampled, weighted and convolved function should be equal to the
objective function at the sampled points. That is,
$$\Bigg(m_{SWC}(x,y)\Bigg)_S = \Bigg(m(x,y)\Bigg)_S.$$ Thus, what we
want is to be able to recover a *continuous* function $m(x,y)$ from the
*discrete sequence* of values at the sampled points by doing a
convolution. Suppose that our Fourier grid sampling is done by a
function of the form $\Sha(u/u_0,v/v_0)$, such that the grid spacing in
Fourier domain is given by $(1/u_0, 1/v_0)$. The inverse Fourier
transform of this function is also a comb function and has the form
$$\Sha(x,y) = u_0 v_0 \Sha(xu_0, yv_0).$$ The sampled Fourier transform
of our function is given by
$$M_{S}(u,v) = M(u,v) \cdot \Sha(u/u_0, v/v_0).$$ Its inverse Fourier
transform is given by $$\begin{aligned}
m_{S}(x,y) &= m(x,y) \ast u_0v_0\Sha(xu_0, yv_0)\\
&= m(x,y) \ast u_0v_0\sum_j \sum_k \delta(xu_0-j, yv_0-k)\\
&=\sum_j \sum_k m\Big(x - \frac{k}{u_0}, y - \frac{j}{v_0}\Big).\end{aligned}$$
Additional weights can be added as constants multiplied to the sampling
function. Here, we consider all weights to be equal to 1.

The function we want to reconstruct, $m(x,y)$, has compact support. We
define its support such that $m(x,y) = 0$ for $x>|x_0|$ or $y>|y_0|$. We
make use of the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula, which is a
method to reconstruct a continuous time, bandlimited function from a
sequence of real numbers. Given $x[n] = x(nT)$, a sequence of real
numbers with sampling period $T$, the formula states that
$$x(t) = \sum_n x[n] \text{ sinc}\Bigg( \frac{t-nT}{T}\Bigg)$$ is a
perfect reconstruction of the original function $x(t)$ if the bandlimit
of the function, $B$, is less than the Nyquist frequency,
$\frac{1}{2T}$. The reconstruction is equivalently given by
$$x(t) = \Bigg(\sum_n x[n] \cdot \delta(t-nT)\Bigg) \ast \text{ sinc}\Bigg( \frac{t}{T}\Bigg).$$
The function we want to reconstruct, $m(x,y)$, has compact support in
real space and its limits are given by $(x \leq x_0, y \leq y_0)$.
Therefore, we can reconstruct it perfectly by multiplying its sampled
Fourier transform with a sinc function, as shown in (17) and (18). To
avoid aliasing, the sampling period in Fourier domain must obey the
following $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2u_0} > x_0 \\
\frac{1}{2v_0} > y_0\end{aligned}$$ Following (18), we have
$$M_{SC}(u,v) =\Bigg( \frac{1}{u_0v_0} \sum_k \sum_j M(u,v) \cdot \delta(u-ku_0, v-jv_0)\Bigg) \ast \text{sinc}\Bigg(\frac{u}{u_0}\Bigg)\text{sinc}\Bigg(\frac{v}{v_0}\Bigg),$$
where the term inside the first parentheses is $M_{S}(u,v)$. Thus, we
get a form for the kernel $C(u,v)$ in Fourier space:
$$C(u,v) = \frac{1}{u_0v_0}\text{sinc}\Bigg(\frac{u}{u_0}\Bigg)\text{sinc}\Bigg(\frac{v}{v_0}\Bigg).$$
Taking $x_1 = 1/2u_0$ and $y_1 = 1/2v_0$, we can rewrite this as
$$C(u,v) = 4x_1 y_1 \text{sinc}(2x_1 u) \text{sinc}(2y_1 v).$$
$M_{SC}(u,v)$ is a perfect reconstruction of the continuous function
$M(u,v)$ if $$\begin{aligned}
x_0 < x_1 \\
y_0 < y_1.\end{aligned}$$ In real space, the sinc function in (23) is an
ideal brick-wall low pass filter $c(x,y)$, such that $$\begin{aligned}
c(x,y) &= 1, |x| \leq x_1 \text{ \& } |y| \leq y_1 \\
&= 0, \text{otherwise}.\end{aligned}$$ Then,
$$m_{SC}(x,y) = m_{S}(x,y) \cdot c(x,y) = m(x,y)$$ provided that
$$\begin{aligned}
x_0 \leq x_1 < \frac{1}{u_0} - x_0 \\
y_0 \leq y_1 < \frac{1}{v_0} - y_0\end{aligned}$$ The interpolation is
completed by resampling the continuous function onto a grid (in our
case, Cartesian) with spacing $(u_1, v_1)$
$$m_{SCS}(x,y)=\sum_j \sum_k m_{SC}\Big(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1}\Big),$$
provided $$\begin{aligned}
x_0 < \frac{1}{2u_1}\\
y_0 < \frac{1}{2v_1}.\end{aligned}$$

Thus, *exact* interpolation to the Cartesian grid is possible. Note that
in the case of the sinc kernel, the contribution of the kernel does not
have to be removed after the inverse Fourier transform (a process known
as deapodisation) because this kernel is chosen such that the sampled
Fourier transform is *exactly equal* to the Fourier transform of the
objective function on the Cartesian grid.

Finite kernel
-------------

The sinc kernel has infinite extent and therefore convolution with the
sinc kernel is computationally infeasible. Now, we consider the case
that the kernel $C(u,v)$ has finite extent, which implies that its
inverse Fourier transform $c(x,y)$ no longer has compact support. We
also relax the condition that $m(x,y)$ has compact support (because of
the finite sampling of $M_S(u,v)$ due to measurement). Thus, the
function $$m_{SC}(x,y) = m_S(x,y) \cdot c(x,y)$$ is of infinite extent
and we take into account only a truncated version of this function for
$|x|<x_1, |y|<y_1$. In general, the sampling of this function
$$m_{SCS}(x,y) = \sum_j \sum_k m_{SC}\Bigg(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1} \Bigg)$$
is not an accurate representation of $m_{SC}(x,y)$ and is affected by
aliasing errors. In general, the gridding method for functions of
non-compact support does not correspond to an exact interpolation and
the values of the sampled function do not match the values of the
objective function exactly, even at the measurement points. However, the
objective function can be estimated by deapodisation:
$$m_e(x,y) = \frac{m_{SCS}(x,y)}{c(x,y)}, |x|<x_1 \text{ \& } |y|<y_1,$$
where $m_e(x,y)$ is the estimate of the objective function $m(x,y)$. The
central point ($k=0, j=0$) is computed exactly by deapodisation. At the
other points, the error in the estimated function is given by
$$\begin{aligned}
m_e(x,y) - m_{S}(x,y) &= \frac{m_{SCS}(x,y)}{c(x,y)} - m_{S}(x,y) \\
&= \frac{1}{c(x,y)}\sum_j \sum_k m_{SC}\Bigg(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1} \Bigg) - m_S(x,y)\\
&= \frac{1}{c(x,y)}\sum_j \sum_k m_{S}\Bigg(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1} \Bigg) \cdot c\Bigg( x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1}\Bigg) - m_S(x,y) \\
&= \frac{1}{c(x,y)}\sum_{j\neq0} \sum_{k\neq0} m_{S}\Bigg(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1} \Bigg) \cdot c\Bigg( x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1}\Bigg)\end{aligned}$$

The accuracy of the gridding method depends on the rate of decay of
$c(x,y)$ outside the region of interest ($|x| \leq x_1, |y| \leq y_1$).
An optimality criterion for the selection of a suitable kernel was
proposed by Schwab in a 1983 paper:
$$R  = \ddfrac{\iint_A |c(x,y)|^2 w(x,y) dx dy}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |c(x,y)|^2 w(x,y) dx dy},$$
where $A$ is the region in which $c(x,y)$ should be concentrated and
$w(x,y)$ are weight functions. Schwab also showed that $R$ is maximised
by zero-order prolate spheroidal wavefunctions, which can be
approximated by Kaiser-Bessel window functions.
