Review of gridding method
=========================

This is a review of the findings of O'Sullivan, 1985 and Jackson et al.,
1991. These papers deal with the gridding method and its specific
application to tomography. Also, the sinc function is shown to be the
ideal interpolation kernel in Fourier domain.

Gridding method
---------------

We consider a 2D function in real space $m(x,y)$ whose Fourier transform
$M(u,v)$ is given by
$$M(u,v) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} m(x,y) e^{2\pi i (ux+vy)} dx dy.$$
In the tomography case, $M(u,v)$ is the Fourier transform of the image
we want to reconstruct.

We also define a sampling function $S(u,v)$ in Fourier space, which is
given by $$S(u,v) = \sum_{j=i}^{k} \delta(u-u_j, v-v_j).$$ The 2D delta
function in the equation above *samples* a function at points
$(u_j, v_j)$, which form any grid (i.e.Â not necessarily Cartesian) in
Fourier space. If we multiply this function to $M(u,v)$, we get a
sampled Fourier transform $$M_S(u,v) = M(u,v) \cdot S(u,v).$$ The fist
step of the gridding method is to convolve the sampled Fourier transform
with a suitable kernel $C(u,v)$:
$$M_{SC}(u,v) = (M(u,v) \cdot S(u,v)) \ast C(u,v),$$ where the
subscripts in $M_{SC}(u,v)$ denote the operations sampling and
convolution, respectively.

Next, the convolution shown above is sampled at Cartesian points
$$M_{SCS}(u,v) = \{(M(u,v) \cdot S(u,v)) \ast C(u,v)\} \cdot \Sha(u,v),$$
where $\Sha(u,v)$ denotes the Shah or comb function
$$\Sha(u,v) = \sum_{k} \sum_{j} \delta(u-k,v-j),$$ which samples points
$(k,j)$ that are equally spaced.

The reconstructed image $m_{SCS}(x,y)$ is given by the 2D inverse
Fourier transform of $M_{SCS}(u,v)$. Therefore,
$$m_{SCS}(x,y) = \{(m(x,y) \ast s(x,y)) \cdot c(x,y)\} \ast \Sha(x,y)$$

If the Fourier transform $M(u,v)$ is not sufficiently sampled by
$S(u,v)$, we cannot correct the aliasing of $m(x,y)$ via
post-processing. However, we can add an additional correction for
non-uniform sampling in Fourier space. For this, we consider an area
density function given by $$\rho(u,v) = S(u,v) \ast C(u,v).$$ Areas that
are oversampled have a large area density while those that are
undersampled have a small area density. Including this contribution in
(5), we get a sampled and weighted function
$$M_{SWCS}(u,v) = \{\Bigg\{\Bigg(M(u,v) \cdot \frac{S(u,v)}{S(u,v) \ast C(u,v)}\Bigg) \ast C(u,v)\Bigg\}\} \cdot \Sha(u,v)$$
and its corresponding inverse Fourier transform
$$m_{SWCS}(x,y) =  \{(m(x,y) \ast (s(x,y) \ast^{-1} (s(x,y) \cdot c(x,y)))) \cdot c(x,y)\} \ast \Sha(x,y),$$
where $\ast^{-1}$ denotes deconvolution.

The question that presents itself at this stage is how to choose a
kernel $C(u,v)$. This is discussed in the following section.

Ideal interpolation
-------------------

We note that for an ideal interpolation, the inverse Fourier transform
of our sampled, weighted and convolved function should be equal to the
objective function at the sampled points. That is,
$$\Bigg(m_{SWC}(x,y)\Bigg)_S = \Bigg(m(x,y)\Bigg)_S.$$ Thus, what we
want is to be able to recover a *continuous* function $m(x,y)$ from the
*discrete sequence* of values at the sampled points by doing a
convolution. Suppose that our Fourier grid sampling is done by a
function of the form $\Sha(u/u_0,v/v_0)$, such that the grid spacing in
Fourier domain is given by $(1/u_0, 1/v_0)$. The inverse Fourier
transform of this function is also a comb function and has the form
$$\Sha(x,y) = u_0 v_0 \Sha(xu_0, yv_0).$$ The sampled Fourier transform
of our function is given by
$$M_{S}(u,v) = M(u,v) \cdot \Sha(u/u_0, v/v_0).$$ Its inverse Fourier
transform is given by $$\begin{aligned}
m_{S}(x,y) &= m(x,y) \ast u_0v_0\Sha(xu_0, yv_0)\\
&= m(x,y) \ast u_0v_0\sum_j \sum_k \delta(xu_0-j, yv_0-k)\\
&=\sum_j \sum_k m\Big(x - \frac{k}{u_0}, y - \frac{j}{v_0}\Big).\end{aligned}$$
Additional weights can be added as constants multiplied to the sampling
function. Here, we consider all weights to be equal to 1.

The function we want to reconstruct, $m(x,y)$, has compact support. We
define its support such that $m(x,y) = 0$ for $x>|x_0|$ or $y>|y_0|$. We
make use of the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula, which is a
method to reconstruct a continuous time, bandlimited function from a
sequence of real numbers. Given $x(n) = x(nT)$, a sequence of real
numbers with sampling period $T$, the formula states that
$$x(t) = \sum_n x(n) \text{ sinc}\Bigg( \frac{t-nT}{T}\Bigg)$$ is a
perfect reconstruction of the original function $x(t)$ if the bandlimit
of the function, $B$, is less than the Nyquist frequency,
$\frac{1}{2T}$. The reconstruction is equivalently given by
$$x(t) = \Bigg(\sum_n x(n) \cdot \delta(t-nT)\Bigg) \ast \text{ sinc}\Bigg( \frac{t}{T}\Bigg).$$
The function we want to reconstruct, $m(x,y)$, has compact support in
real space and its limits are given by $(x \leq x_0, y \leq y_0)$.
Therefore, we can reconstruct it perfectly by multiplying its sampled
Fourier transform with a sinc function, as shown in (17) and (18). To
avoid aliasing, the sampling period in Fourier domain must obey the
following $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2u_0} > x_0 \\
\frac{1}{2v_0} > y_0\end{aligned}$$ Following (18), we have
$$M_{SC}(u,v) =\Bigg( \frac{1}{u_0v_0} \sum_k \sum_j M(u,v) \cdot \delta(u-ku_0, v-jv_0)\Bigg) \ast \text{sinc}\Bigg(\frac{u}{u_0}\Bigg)\text{sinc}\Bigg(\frac{v}{v_0}\Bigg),$$
where the term inside the first parentheses is $M_{S}(u,v)$. Thus, we
get a form for the kernel $C(u,v)$ in Fourier space:
$$C(u,v) = \frac{1}{u_0v_0}\text{sinc}\Bigg(\frac{u}{u_0}\Bigg)\text{sinc}\Bigg(\frac{v}{v_0}\Bigg).$$
Taking $x_1 = 1/2u_0$ and $y_1 = 1/2v_0$, we can rewrite this as
$$C(u,v) = 4x_1 y_1 \text{sinc}(2x_1 u) \text{sinc}(2y_1 v).$$
$M_{SC}(u,v)$ is a perfect reconstruction of the continuous function
$M(u,v)$ if $$\begin{aligned}
x_0 < x_1 \\
y_0 < y_1.\end{aligned}$$ In real space, the sinc function in (23) is an
ideal brick-wall low pass filter $c(x,y)$, such that $$\begin{aligned}
c(x,y) &= 1, |x| \leq x_1 \text{ \& } |y| \leq y_1 \\
&= 0, \text{otherwise}.\end{aligned}$$ Then,
$$m_{SC}(x,y) = m_{S}(x,y) \cdot c(x,y) = m(x,y)$$ provided that
$$\begin{aligned}
x_0 \leq x_1 < \frac{1}{u_0} - x_0 \\
y_0 \leq y_1 < \frac{1}{v_0} - y_0\end{aligned}$$ The interpolation is
completed by resampling the continuous function onto a grid (in our
case, Cartesian) with spacing $(u_1, v_1)$
$$m_{SCS}(x,y)=\sum_j \sum_k m_{SC}\Big(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1}\Big),$$
provided $$\begin{aligned}
x_0 < \frac{1}{2u_1}\\
y_0 < \frac{1}{2v_1}.\end{aligned}$$

Thus, *exact* interpolation to the Cartesian grid is possible. Note that
in the case of the sinc kernel, the contribution of the kernel does not
have to be removed after the inverse Fourier transform (a process known
as deapodisation) because this kernel is chosen such that the sampled
Fourier transform is *exactly equal* to the Fourier transform of the
objective function on the Cartesian grid.

Finite kernel
-------------

The sinc kernel has infinite extent and therefore convolution with the
sinc kernel is computationally infeasible. Now, we consider the case
that the kernel $C(u,v)$ has finite extent, which implies that its
inverse Fourier transform $c(x,y)$ no longer has compact support. We
also relax the condition that $m(x,y)$ has compact support (because of
the finite sampling of $M_S(u,v)$ due to measurement). Thus, the
function $$m_{SC}(x,y) = m_S(x,y) \cdot c(x,y)$$ is of infinite extent
and we take into account only a truncated version of this function for
$|x|<x_1, |y|<y_1$. In general, the sampling of this function
$$m_{SCS}(x,y) = \sum_j \sum_k m_{SC}\Bigg(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1} \Bigg)$$
is not an accurate representation of $m_{SC}(x,y)$ and is affected by
aliasing errors. In general, the gridding method for functions of
non-compact support does not correspond to an exact interpolation and
the values of the sampled function do not match the values of the
objective function exactly, even at the measurement points. However, the
objective function can be estimated by deapodisation:
$$m_e(x,y) = \frac{m_{SCS}(x,y)}{c(x,y)}, |x|<x_1 \text{ \& } |y|<y_1,$$
where $m_e(x,y)$ is the estimate of the objective function $m(x,y)$. The
central point ($k=0, j=0$) is computed exactly by deapodisation. At the
other points, the error in the estimated function is given by
$$\begin{aligned}
m_e(x,y) - m_{S}(x,y) &= \frac{m_{SCS}(x,y)}{c(x,y)} - m_{S}(x,y) \\
&= \frac{1}{c(x,y)}\sum_j \sum_k m_{SC}\Bigg(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1} \Bigg) - m_S(x,y)\\
&= \frac{1}{c(x,y)}\sum_j \sum_k m_{S}\Bigg(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1} \Bigg) \cdot c\Bigg( x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1}\Bigg) - m_S(x,y) \\
&= \frac{1}{c(x,y)}\sum_{j\neq0} \sum_{k\neq0} m_{S}\Bigg(x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1} \Bigg) \cdot c\Bigg( x - \frac{k}{u_1}, y - \frac{j}{v_1}\Bigg)\end{aligned}$$

The accuracy of the gridding method depends on the rate of decay of
$c(x,y)$ outside the region of interest ($|x| \leq x_1, |y| \leq y_1$).
An optimality criterion for the selection of a suitable kernel was
proposed by Schwab in a 1983 paper:
$$R  = \frac{\displaystyle \iint_A |c(x,y)|^2 w(x,y) dx dy}{\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |c(x,y)|^2 w(x,y) dx dy},$$
where $A$ is the region in which $c(x,y)$ should be concentrated and
$w(x,y)$ are weight functions. Schwab also showed that $R$ is maximised
by zero-order prolate spheroidal wavefunctions, which can be
approximated by Kaiser-Bessel window functions.

Application of regridding method to Gridrec
===========================================

The gridding method has been used in tomography to perform direct
Fourier inversion from a non-uniformly sampled Fourier domain. The
backprojector in such a method corresponds exactly to performing a
gridding operation, while the forward projector is a composition of the
same operations "in reverse".

Formulation of the backprojector
--------------------------------

This is a review of the formulation of the gridding backprojector
introduced in Arcadu et al., 2016. Backprojection is done using a series
of five operations:

1.  1D Fourier transform of projections:
    $\hat{P_\theta}(\omega) = \mathcal{F}_{1D}\{P_\theta(t)\}$

2.  Ramp filtering of projections:
    $\hat{P_\theta}^{(f)}(\omega) = |\omega| \cdot \hat{P_\theta}(\omega)$

3.  Convolution with interpolation kernel:
    $\hat{f}^{(m)} = \hat{c} \ast \hat{P_\theta}^{(f)}(\omega)$

4.  2D inverse Fourier transform of the image:
    $f^{(m)} = \mathcal{F}^{-1}_{2D}\{\hat{f}^{(m)}\}$

5.  Removal of the interpolation kernel (deapodisation): $f = f^m/c$

We can write down the backprojection operation using the sampling and
convolution functions introduced in the previous sections (cf eq.Â 10):
$$f_{SWCSD}(x,y) =  \Bigg(\Big\{\big(f(x,y) \ast (s(x,y) \ast^{-1} \rho(x,y))\big) \cdot c(x,y)\Big\} \ast \Sha(x,y)\Bigg) \cdot \frac{\Pi(x,y)}{c(x,y)},$$
where $\Pi(x,y)$ is the boxcar function,
$\Pi(x,y) = 1; |x|<1/2,|y|<1/2$, used to crop the reconstruction to the
region of interest and $\rho(x,y) = s(x,y) \cdot c(x,y)$ is the inverse
Fourier transform of the area density function introduced in (8).

Forward projection is done by applying the operations in reverse.
However, ramp filtering, which is done in backprojection to compensate
for the non-uniform sampling in the Fourier domain, is not performed.
Therefore, we can write down forward projection as: $$\begin{aligned}
f_{DSCS}(x,y) &= \Bigg(\Big\{\big(f(x,y) / c(x,y)\big) \cdot \Sha(x,y)\Big\} \cdot c(x,y)\Bigg) \ast s(x,y) \\
&= \Bigg(\Big\{\big(f(x,y) \cdot \Sha(x,y)\big) / c(x,y) \Big\} \cdot c(x,y)\Bigg) \ast s(x,y) \\
&= \Bigg(f(x,y) \cdot \Sha(x,y) \Bigg) \ast s(x,y).\end{aligned}$$ We
see from the equations above, that forward projection can be seen as a
sampling of the function by a Shah function $\Sha(x,y)$, followed by
resampling onto a different (possibly non-uniform) grid in Fourier
space.

Computation of minimum residual filters
=======================================

To compute a minimum residual filter, we first multiply the sinogram
data with a basis filter, then apply the backprojection and forward
projection operators in succession. We repeat this for all the basis
filters and each forward projection forms a column of the matrix G,
which we use to minimise the residual and obtain an optimum filter:
$$h^\ast = \text{argmin}_h ||Gh - P||^2_2.$$ Therefore, $G$ can be
written as a composition of filtering, backprojection and forward
projection, i.e. $$G = W_G W^T_G C_h,$$ where $W^T_G$ denotes the
Gridrec backprojection operator, $W_G$ denotes the forward projection
operator and $C_h$ denotes convolution (in real space) with a filter
$h$.

\color{gray}
If the sinc kernel had been used for interpolation in Fourier domain, we
would not need to perform any deapodisation. This would imply that we
would not need to go through image space to compute the action of
$W_G W^T_G$.

We now want to explore what would happen if we did not do any
deapodisation in image space even when it is necessary. Without
deapodisation, from (42), we have
$$f_{SWCS}(x,y) = f_{SWCSD}(x,y) \cdot c(x,y) = \Big\{\big(f(x,y) \ast (s(x,y) \ast^{-1} \rho(x,y))\big) \cdot c(x,y)\Big\} \ast \Sha(x,y).$$
Plugging this expression into the forward projection equation, i.e.
(45), we get
$$f_{DSCS}(x,y) = \Bigg(\Big\{f_{SWCSD}(x,y) \cdot c(x,y)\Big\}\cdot \Sha(x,y) \Bigg) \ast s(x,y).$$
From the last equation, we see that the effect of the interpolation
kernel $c(x,y)$ is present in the forward projection. Therefore, we
cannot use this forward projection to minimise the residual w.r.t.Â the
actual data. However, as the operations performed in (49) are simply
sampling operations, we could deapodise after the forward projection, to
remove the contribution of $c(x,y)$.
